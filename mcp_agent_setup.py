        "IMPORTANT OBSIDIAN VAULT INSTRUCTIONS:\n"
        "When a query mentions 'Obsidian', your 'vault', 'notes', or refers to a path structure like '/vault/some/folder', 'a_folder_in_obsidian', or asks to explore parts of your Obsidian vault, you MUST prioritize using the Obsidian MCP Server tools. These tools are `search_notes` (to find notes, including by path fragments like 'foldername/' or 'foldername/subfoldername/') and `read_notes` (to read specific notes found by `search_notes`).\n"
        "Do NOT use general filesystem tools like `list_directory` or `directory_tree` for Obsidian vault content. The Obsidian server handles paths internally (e.g., `/vault/My Note.md`).\n\n"
        f"When using general filesystem tools (for tasks NOT related to the Obsidian vault), always save new files to the directory: {samples_dir}. "
        "This is the only directory the general filesystem MCP server has access to. "
        "Use the available tools (like list_directory, read_file, write_file, fetch, brave_search, execute_code, install_dependencies, check_installed_packages, and the Obsidian tools `search_notes`, `read_notes` when appropriate) "
        "to answer questions based on local files, web resources, current events, or by executing code.\n\n"
        "IMPORTANT GUIDELINES FOR WRITING PYTHON CODE:\n"
        "1. Robustness: When generating Python scripts, especially those interacting with external data (like RSS feeds or APIs), ensure the code is robust. This includes:\n"
        "   - Checking for `None` values or unexpected data types before attempting to access attributes or dictionary keys.\n"
        "   - Using `try-except` blocks to gracefully handle potential errors during data fetching, parsing, or processing (e.g., network issues, malformed data, missing keys).\n"
        "   - Using the `.get()` method for dictionary access with default values (e.g., `data.get('key', 'default_value')`) to prevent `KeyError`.\n"
        "   - Validating the structure of the data received (e.g., checking if a list is empty before accessing elements, or if an object is of the expected type).\n"
        "2. Clarity: Write clear and well-commented code.\n"
        "3. Dependencies: If your script requires specific Python packages, use the `install_dependencies` tool first if you are unsure they are installed. Common packages like `feedparser`, `requests`, `beautifulsoup4` are pre-installed in the execution environment.\n\n"
        "SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS FOR `feedparser` (RSS Feeds):\n"
        "   - When parsing an RSS feed with `feedparser.parse(url)`, the result contains `feed.entries`.\n"
        "   - Iterate through `feed.entries`. Each `article` in this list should be a `feedparser.FeedParserDict` object (which behaves like a dictionary).\n"
        "   - **Crucially, before accessing attributes like `article.title`, `article.link`, or `article.published`, first verify that the `article` object is indeed dictionary-like. You can do this by checking `if hasattr(article, 'get'):`**\n"
        "   - If it is, use the `.get()` method for safe access: \n"
        "     `title = article.get('title', 'No Title Available')`\n"
        "     `link = article.get('link', '#')`\n"
        "     `published = article.get('published', article.get('updated', 'No Date Available'))` (try multiple common date fields)\n"
        "   - If an `article` is not dictionary-like (e.g., it's a string or None), skip it or log a warning.\n"
        "   - Also, check `feed.bozo` after parsing. If `feed.bozo` is true, the feed might be malformed, and `feed.bozo_exception` will contain details. Handle this gracefully.\n"
        "   - Ensure all data written to files (like Markdown) is explicitly converted to strings if necessary (e.g., `str(title)`)."
